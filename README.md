### Tools Used:

- **MySQL:** Data storage, transformation, and analysis
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards and geographic visualization
- **DAX:** Advanced calculated measures for performance metrics

#### Key Metrics Developed:

- Dynamic delivery time calculations accounting for traffic density
- Driver efficiency scoring across shift patterns
- Restaurant performance indexing
- Peak demand forecasting indicators

## Executive Summary

### Key Performance Metrics:

- **Average delivery time:** 9 minutes (0.15 hours)
- **Order completion rate:** 35% delivered, 65% pending
- **Average traffic density:** 70 vehicles per minute
- **Driver utilization:** 50 active drivers across 3 shift patterns


#### Critical Findings:

- **Delivery Performance:** The company maintains consistent delivery performance with an average of **9 minutes per delivery**. However, with **65%** of orders still pending, there's a significant backlog indicating capacity constraints or routing inefficiencies.

- **Traffic Impact:** Traffic density varies dramatically **(range: 2-194 vehicles/minute)**, directly correlating with delivery times. Peak congestion occurs during **morning hours (7 AM)**, suggesting the need for dynamic routing algorithms that account for real-time traffic conditions.

- **Operational Bottlenecks:** Restaurant performance analysis reveals significant variations in preparation times, with some locations showing consistently higher delays. Top-performing restaurants handle **61-68 orders** efficiently, while underperforming locations create delivery cascading delays.

### Insights Deep Dive

#### Peak Demand Analysis

- **Finding:** **Wednesday and Thursday** show the highest order volumes **(176 and 167 orders respectively)**, with **7 AM** identified as the most busy hour of the day.

- **Business Impact:** This concentration of demand during specific time windows creates resource allocation challenges. The morning peak at **7 AM** suggests breakfast delivery demand that may require dedicated driver scheduling and restaurant partnerships optimized for quick morning preparation.

#### Driver Performance Patterns

- **Finding:** Driver **Thomas McDonald handles 36 orders (highest volume)**, while shift lengths remain standardized at **6-8 hours**. However, performance analysis reveals delivery time variations ranging from 0.084 to 0.201 hours across different drivers.

- **Business Impact:** The 2.4x performance difference between top and bottom performers indicates significant opportunity for driver training, route optimization, or performance-based incentives. High-performing drivers like **Jacqueline Chen (0.084 hour average)** demonstrate achievable efficiency benchmarks.

#### Geographic Performance Variations

- **Finding:** Traffic density analysis reveals location-specific challenges with some areas experiencing up to **194 vehicles per minute** during peak periods, while others maintain lower congestion **(under 10 vehicles per minute)**.

- **Business Impact:** The geographic visualization identifies specific high-congestion zones requiring alternative routing strategies. Areas with consistent high traffic density should be prioritized for dedicated delivery hubs or partnership with local micro-fulfillment centers.

#### Restaurant Efficiency Analysis

- **Finding:** Restaurant performance varies significantly, with **Ryan, Alexander and Willis** showing the **highest delays (10.8 minute average)**, while **Nguyen-Lopez (68 orders)** demonstrates high volume with reasonable delivery times.

- **Business Impact:** Underperforming restaurants create bottlenecks that affect overall network efficiency. These locations require operational support, menu optimization for faster preparation, or adjusted delivery time estimates to manage customer expectations.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (0-30 days)

- **Driver Shift Standardization:** Implement uniform **7-hour shifts** across all drivers to address current workload imbalances. Currently, drivers work varying shifts **(6-8 hours)**, creating unfair distribution where some drivers are overworked while others are underutilized. Standardizing shifts would improve driver satisfaction and ensure consistent service coverage.
- **Dynamic Routing Implementation:** Deploy traffic-aware routing algorithms that adjust delivery sequences based on real-time congestion data. Given the 70+ vehicle per minute average traffic density, static routing is insufficient for optimal performance.
- **Driver Performance Optimization:** Implement training programs based on top-performer methodologies. With delivery time variations up to 140% between drivers, standardizing best practices could improve overall network efficiency by 15-20%.
- **Peak Hour Resource Allocation:** Increase driver availability during identified peak periods **(Wednesday/Thursday, 7 AM peak)** through flexible scheduling or surge pricing incentives.

### Strategic Initiatives (30-90 days)

- **Restaurant Partnership Optimization:** Work closely with underperforming restaurants **(those with >10 minute average delays)** to streamline operations. Consider kitchen optimization consultations or adjusted commission structures based on preparation efficiency.
- **Geographic Hub Strategy:** Establish micro-fulfillment centers in high-traffic density areas **(>150 vehicles/minute)** to reduce last-mile delivery distances and improve customer experience in challenging locations.
- **Predictive Demand Modeling:** Develop forecasting models based on identified patterns **(day-of-week trends, hourly peaks)** to proactively manage capacity and reduce the current 65% pending order backlog.


#### Analytical Approach:
The analysis combines descriptive analytics (what happened) with diagnostic insights (why it happened) to provide actionable business recommendations. 
Time-series analysis identifies patterns, while geographic clustering reveals location-specific optimization opportunities.
